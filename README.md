## Amazon Shipping Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
Amazon Shipping is a global logistics service that handles the shipping of a wide range of Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG). The Shipping Manager, responsible for overseeing the smooth flow of shipments, previously lacked a clear and detailed overview of the shipping operations on a monthly basis.

To address this gap, an interactive Amazon Shipping Analytics Dashboard was created to provide real-time insights into shipping performance. This dashboard allows the Shipping Manager to easily track order volumes, shipping statuses, and destinations across different time periods. It enables quick decision-making based on up-to-date data, thus improving operational efficiency.

## Objective
The primary objective of the dashboard is to provide an interactive platform where the Shipping Manager can:

Select different months and years to view shipping performance.
Track the number of outstanding orders on a daily basis.
Identify shipping destinations and monitor where orders need to be shipped.
Make data-driven decisions based on shipping analytics to improve logistics and overall performance.
With this dashboard, the Shipping Manager can quickly gauge performance metrics and ensure that operations stay on track without having to manually sift through raw data or reports.

## Features
1. Month and Year Selector: The dashboard allows the user to filter shipping data by selecting the desired month and year, providing flexibility in tracking historical data.

2. Outstanding Orders Tracker: A daily breakdown of how many orders are still outstanding, enabling the Shipping Manager to quickly assess the backlog.

3. Shipping Destination Overview: Insights into where the orders need to be shipped, helping logistics teams streamline their processes and ensure timely delivery.

4. Interactive Visualizations: Various data visualizations, including bar charts, heat maps, and line graphs, to display shipping performance metrics in a user-friendly manner.

## Data Sources
The dashboard is built using multiple CSV files containing crucial data related to Amazon Shipping. These files provide detailed records about orders, products, customers, regions, and more. The data is periodically updated to ensure the dashboard reflects the latest shipping trends. Below are the CSV files included in the project:

- `categories.csv`: Contains product category information.
- `customers.csv`: Information about customers placing orders.
- `employee_territories.csv`: Employee and territory assignment data.
- `employees.csv`: Details about employees involved in shipping and logistics.
